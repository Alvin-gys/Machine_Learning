# GaitGAN
Pytorch implementation of "GaitGAN: Invariant Gait Feature Extraction Using Generative Adversarial Networks", its unfinished yet.

The network framework is based on DCGAN, you can see the code of DCGAN in pytorch in the webside: https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/dcgan/main.py

Also, the structure of GaitGAN network is similar to "PixelDTGAN",
in the webside of: https://github.com/fxia22/PixelDTGAN/
and the bug-fixed version in : https://github.com/nashory/pixel-level-dt-torch

Dataset preparation:
GEIs of CASIA-B DataSet
