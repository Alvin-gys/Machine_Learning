GaitGAN based on Pytorch

This is a implementation of "GaitGAN: Invariant Gait Feature Extraction Using Generative Adversarial Networks" in Pytorch, its unfinished yet.

The network framework is similar to DCGAN, you can see the code of DCGAN in pytorch in the webside: https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/master/dcgan/main.py
